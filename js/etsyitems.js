I create Silicone molds, pour resins\/dyes\/other colourants and spend MANY hours sculpting and sanding to create a unique shape. \n\nI do not use artificial shine on my resin pieces (no varnish, glaze, floor polish, car polish etc). I use finely gritted sand paper, a ton of time and a variety of resins to create the luster! Care instructions will be provided with your purchase.\n\nMy jewelry is made with a variety of resins. Polyurethane Resin is used to cast this ring. This resin is UV stable with a high heat tolerance, meaning it won&#39;t yellow in the sun and it won&#39;t soften with body heat.
